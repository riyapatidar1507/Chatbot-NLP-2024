# Chatbot-NLP-2024

This is a simple chatbot system created for library-related queries. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to provide users with answers about library hours, book availability, borrowing policies, and more. The system is built using Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit for a web-based interface.

## Features

- Basic library-related questions such as opening hours, book availability, and borrowing rules.
- Trained using sample intents in a JSON format.
- Uses NLTK for text processing and scikit-learn for building a machine learning model.
- Web interface powered by Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary language for building the chatbot.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing and tokenization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models (SVM classifier).
- **Streamlit**: A framework to create interactive web apps with Python.

## Files in the Repository

- **library_chatbot.py**: The main Python file where the chatbot logic is implemented.
- **intent.json**: A JSON file containing the intents and responses for the chatbot.

## Usage:

Ask the chatbot basic library-related questions, such as:
- "What are the library hours?"
- "Is the book available?"
- "How many books can I borrow?"

## Conclusion:

This chatbot project is a beginner-level implementation to showcase how machine learning and NLP can be used to automate library-related tasks. It can be expanded with additional features such as more complex intents, integration with databases, and better user interaction. It's a great starting point for anyone looking to explore the basics of chatbots and NLP.
